## How to Set Up
Add the env file to the base ConfSpotter Folder \
Rename the env to include the . in front of it so it should fully read .env \
If done corretly the .env file will be grayed out 
In the .env file change the DB password to your DB password and change the user to root if in needed in the username line

If on Mac open a terminal and run ``bash setup.sh`` (There is a .bat file for windows but it has not been tested)\ 
Once complete open a new terminal and run ``cd frontend && npm run dev``

## ACID Compliance & Transaction Management
- Guarantees Data Integrity
- Error Handling is Simplified
- Reduced Bugs and Inconsistencies
- System as a whole is more reliable (to users and devs)
- No more states of confusion (through Isolation)
